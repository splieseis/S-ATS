S-ATS is a simple applicant tracking system I made to practice all the new fundamentals I learned in C++.

***

So far you can do the following tasks with S-ATS:

* N - New Applicant
* L - List Applicants
* P - Preferences & Change settings
* Search - Search Information about an Applicant

***
When you close your current S-ATS session you'll be automaticly asked if you want to save your data in an .csv file and you can even enable an encrypted output in your preferences.
